A limit is needed to formalise the notion of an _infinite process_. Archimedes approximated shapes
with methods of exhaustion. In approximating pi, he says, "there is a number that exists in between
these two constraints if such constraints were reduced ad infinitum".

**Something does not need to be defined at $c$ to discuss its limit.** Cauchy uses$ \frac{sin(x)}{x}$ to
show this. Using the inequality

$$ 1 \lt \frac{sin(x)}{x} \gt cos(x) $$

As x goes to zero, we see that $\frac{sing(x)}{x} $ approaches 1. A counter-intuitive result.

The intuition of the value of the limit is gained numerically, rather than analytically.

The general intuition that the limit of some function at a poing $c$ is the function evaluated at
that points $c$ operates of the idea of a continuous function.


```{julia}
using SymPy
f(x) = (sqrt(x) - 5) / (sqrt(x-16) - 3)
c = 25
f(c) # NaN
hs = [1/10^i for i in 1:8 ] # If this was changed to 10...
xs = c .+ hs
ys = f.(xs)
[xs ys]
```

Greater and greater granularity hits the limits of floating point representation. Numerical
approaches are limited or should be acknowledged as limited.

Investigating

$$\lim_{x â†’ \frac{15}{11}}h(x)$$

```{julia}
h(x) = x^2 + 1  + log(abs(11x - 15))/99
c = 15/11
hs = [1/10^i for i in 4:3:16]
xs = c .+ hs
[xs h.(xs)]
```
